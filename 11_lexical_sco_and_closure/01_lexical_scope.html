<!-- inner() is lexically inside outer()

So inner() has access to name, even though name is not declared inside inner()

This is lexical scoping

ðŸ’¡ Important Points:
Scope is decided at the time of writing code, not at runtime

Inner functions remember the scope they were created in

This leads to the concept of closures (functions that remember outer variables) -->
